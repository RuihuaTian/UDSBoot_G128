Module "CAN1"      (component Init_MSCAN_HCS12)
   - CAN1_Init -This method initializes registers of the CAN module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "TJA1043_STB" (component BitIO)
   - TJA1043_STB_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - TJA1043_STB_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property 
                for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - TJA1043_STB_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - TJA1043_STB_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - TJA1043_STB_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "rti"       (component Init_RTI_HCS12)
   - rti_Init -This method initializes registers of the RTI module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "AD_BATT"   (component ADC)
   - AD_BATT_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If 
                the <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of 
                times.)
   - AD_BATT_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels justified to the left. Compared with 
                <GetValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and 
                <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S12G128_48)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.  For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU.  
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.  For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
